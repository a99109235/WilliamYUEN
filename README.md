Day1 
At the beginning, How to organize the CSV(data base) which was the first thing. And built-up the flowchart for the application. There were three parts what I think, Reading , Operation, and Writing the Data. 
As the beginner of the programme, I learn building application about basic concept of the structure. And learn the Array command thought the online tutorial and the online source.

Day2
Built-up the read data function and sort the data for list organize. And use the same way to generate the output data to be the CSV.
 I design those function by ArrayList. And try to sequence data in the list. I learn the Data structure about how to add, replace value into the list. 


Day3
Developed the operator about the Data transfer. I try to use library function for operate. However, it was hard to handle for me. 
Finally I use Arraylist to build the operation function. At this programme, I usually search the tutorial of the Java to solve the problem which I melt. 
Even this programme result not fulfil the requitement, only have the basic functions include read, operate, write. Also no UI and testing function. However, this is the good experience for me. 

How to use it:
Main Class is named “Main.java”, which is in model package. You should be able to run it directly.
In main method (Main.java), I input the relative path of TKO.csv & CWB.csv (location) and translation.csv in line 15&16. After run it, user can enter the 
enter 1 for correction, 2 for company list
enter 1 for take from TKO, 2 for take from CWB
enter the product code take from TKO eg.A-01
enter the quantity take from TKO
